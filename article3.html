                    A recent study that simulated a tailgate party found that eating foods high in carbohydrates while consuming relatively lower amounts of alcohol was associated with increased liver fat.

                    The researchers had several criteria for inclusion in the study. They focused on males aged 21–52 years with a sedentary lifestyle, which involved fewer than 3 hours of aerobic exercise per week.

                    Before the experiment, 8 of the 18 participants kept a food diary for 3 days, which showed an average intake of 2,748 kilocalories (kcal) each day. On game day, people ate well beyond this, consuming an average of 5,087 kcal.
