                “We explored whether or not autonomy-supportive parental 
                behavior would facilitate adaptation and better child well-being.
                 We also explored whether such parenting behavior helps to create a
                  positive emotional climate that benefits parents as well as children,” 
                  says study co-author Andreas B. Neubauer, of the Leibniz Institute for Research and Information in Education in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
<br/>
The study found that “autonomy-supportive parenting behavior is 
positively associated both with better child well-being and 
higher parental need fulfillment.”

                Autonomy-based parenting involves allowing a child to operate independently within reasonable boundaries.
<br/>
                With this parenting technique, the adult communicates a nonjudgmental way to the child that allows them to explore their own strategies and solutions without fear of reprisal.
                <br/>
                Therefore, the child gains the opportunity to own their actions and consequences. By removing parental micromanagement, autonomy-based parenting promotes a child’s own feeling of competence.

            <h2>Why are cancer researchers interested in intermittent fasting?</h2>
            <p>
                Breast cancer is one of at least 13 cancers that are sensitive to obesity and the fat composition of the body. Fatty tissue promotes the development and growth of breast cancer. Therefore, weight-loss strategies that can help lower fat and promote a healthy balance between fat and muscle are of interest to breast cancer researchers.

            </p>
            <p>
                We are also learning a lot about the role of insulin and glucose in the growth of breast cancer. It’s well known that hormones like estrogen fuel the growth of cancer cells in nearly 80% of breast cancer cases. We’re learning that insulin has a lot of interplay with hormones like estrogen, and excess body fat can accelerate insulin production.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rationale for investigating intermittent fasting in the context of breast cancer is to test whether this strategy will reduce fat and improve insulin levels, which in turn can help lower estrogen levels and slow the growth of breast tumors.

            <h2>How strong is the research on intermittent fasting and breast cancer?</h2>
            <p>
                This research is in an early phase. There is little research yet on intermittent fasting
                and cancer that involves humans — instead, it’s what we call pre-clinical research, meaning
                in mice and other models. The data from pre-clinical research is promising, but it will take
                rigorous testing to prove whether this will really help people with breast cancer. That research
                is underway and the data are starting to be reported. One recently published study showed no improvement
                in weight or fat loss with a specific intermittent fasting approach. Ongoing studies are testing other
                types of intermittent fasting strategies.
